"# docker_multiserviceapp" 
Description
This project demonstrates a multi-service application using Docker. It includes:

A Flask web server that connects to a MySQL database.
Usage of Docker Compose to manage services.
Implementation of Docker networks for inter-service communication.
Use of Docker volumes to persist MySQL database data.
Custom Dockerfiles to build service-specific images.
Features
Flask App: A Python-based web server.
MySQL Database: Persistent database storage using Docker volumes.
Docker Compose: Simplifies multi-container management.
Networking: Custom Docker network connects the services.
Volume: Ensures MySQL data persists beyond container lifecycle.
Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

Docker: Install Docker
Docker Compose: Included in Docker Desktop or install separately.

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-multi-service-app.git
cd docker-multi-service-app
Build and Start Services: Use Docker Compose to build and start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Access the Application:

Flask App: http://localhost:5000
MySQL Database: Access using a MySQL client with:

Host: localhost
Port: 3306
Username: root
Password: password (or your configured password)
Stop Services: To stop the running containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
Environment Variables
Configure the MySQL database in docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy code
environment:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
  MYSQL_DATABASE: testdb
Key Commands
Build and start containers:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Stop containers:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
View running containers:
bash
Copy code
docker ps
Technical Details
Docker Network: Services communicate using a custom Docker network created by Docker Compose.
Docker Volume: MySQL data is stored in the db_data volume to ensure persistence.
Custom Images: The Flask app is built using a Dockerfile.
Troubleshooting
Error: requirements.txt not found: Ensure the file exists in the web/ directory and is copied in the Dockerfile.
Error: Cannot connect to MySQL: Confirm MySQL service is running and accessible on the defined network.
